{"text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- More than five years after a video posted to a satirical website went viral, the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats were on their way to another blowout.\nIn a narrow win over the Charlotte Bobcats, the Chicago Bulls (27-41) defeated the Bobcats 106-91 on Saturday.\nQuentin Richardson scored 19 points and John Henson had 13 rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot as the Bulls rolled.\nThe Bobcats, who finished with the fourth-worst record in the league, made only 19 of 65 shots -- 31 percent -- and only eight of their 21 field-goal attempts.\n\"We have an opportunity to go back-to-back now and to get off to a good start,\" said Richardson, who scored eight points in the first quarter and 10 points in the second quarter.\nThe Bulls pulled away in the third quarter as Eric Gordon's 3-pointer put Chicago up 72-39. Gordon finished with 12 points.\n\"The guys played hard and they kept pushing us back to the rim,\" Bobcats coach Mike Dunleavy said. \"They got a bucket from Matt Bonner, and we only got four shots in the fourth quarter.\"\nDeJuan Blair added 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Bulls.\n\"We had eight layups in the first half and we didn't make any in the second half,\" Dunleavy said. \"This is going to be a work in progress from here on out, because we didn't shoot well tonight and we didn't play well in transition.\"\nNikola Vucevic led the Bobcats with 19 points and 11 rebounds, Terrence Williams added 18 points and 11 rebounds, and reserve forward Luke Babbitt had 16 points.\nThe Bobcats committed seven turnovers, including five in the third quarter.\nBlair, the team's leading scorer, said the team wasn't ready to overcome a 37-point deficit.\n\"We know we have a lot of work to do,\" Blair said.\nWhen Gordon and Vucevic combined for eight dunks in the third quarter, things looked dire for the Bulls.\nA fan wearing a pro-Bobcats shirt screamed in the first half to get the crowd into it.\nThe Bulls entered the fourth quarter trailing 39-30, but it didn't matter.\n\"We didn't quit,\" Dunleavy said. \"We just didn't play as well as we should have.\"\nChicago's dominant final stretch gave its two losses in a row. The Bulls shot a season-low 45 percent from the field, and the Bulls' seven turnovers in the fourth quarter -- four of them by the Bobcats -- led to 14 Charlotte points.\n\"We haven't played that well on the road,\" Dunleavy said. \"So we have to finish the job.\"\nIn the regular-season finale, the Bulls won two of three games against the Bobcats -- both at home -- before falling to them in the playoffs.\nWith their season on the line, the Bulls drew off a 15-point fourth quarter lead. They closed within nine in the final 2:43, but missed five straight shots and overtime.\n\"That game at home was a measuring stick,\" Dunleavy said. \"We had to win that game and in overtime, you're going to go to war.\"\n----------\non the Web:\nAP Basketball Writer Andrew Dampf contributed to this report.", "length": 710, "finished": true}
